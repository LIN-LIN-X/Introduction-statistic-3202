Part a)
```{r}
NMC <- 1000
captured <- rep(NA, NMC)

n <-  50
lambda <- 3
alpha <- 0.4
zstar <- qnorm(alpha/2, 0, 1)
  
for(i in 1:NMC){
  x <- rpois(n, lambda)
  xbar <- sum(x)/n
  
  LL <- xbar + zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  UL <- xbar - zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  
  captured[i] <- (LL < lambda) & (UL > lambda)
}

mean(captured)
```
result is 0.592, which is close to (1-.4)

Part b)
```{r}
NMC <- 1000
captured <- rep(NA, NMC)

n <-  20
lambda <- 3
alpha <- 0.005
zstar <- qnorm(alpha/2, 0, 1)
  
for(i in 1:NMC){
  x <- rpois(n, lambda)
  xbar <- sum(x)/n
  
  LL <- xbar + zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  UL <- xbar - zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  
  captured[i] <- (LL < lambda) & (UL > lambda)
}

mean(captured)
```
result is 0.966667, which is not close to 1-.005

```{r}
NMC <- 6

alpha <- 0.4
zstar <- qnorm(alpha/2, 0, 1)
  
for(i in 1:NMC){
  x <- rpois(n, lambda)
  xbar <- sum(x)/n
  
  LL <- xbar + zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  UL <- xbar - zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  
  captured[i] <- (LL < lambda) & (UL > lambda)
}

mean(captured)
```
result is 1, which is not close to 1-.4

```{r}
NMC <- 10000
captured <- rep(NA, NMC)

n <-  20
lambda <- 60
alpha <- 0.4
zstar <- qnorm(alpha/2, 0, 1)
  
for(i in 1:NMC){

  LL <- xbar + zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  UL <- xbar - zstar*sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  
  captured[i] <- (LL < lambda) & (UL > lambda)
}

mean(captured)
```
result is 0.5876, which is close to 1-.4

part c)

n should be as much as possible. $\alpha$ should be not too small or too largeï¼Œ$\lambda$ is parameter, so we don't need care about number of it.
